CloudAid2-ServiceGatherer
=========================

Service Gatherer is a simple Scrapper/Parser of cloud services
information. It recurs to the [Linked USDL Pricing API](https://github.com/jorgearj/USDLPricing_API) to properly
describe/structure the information using the Linked USDL core and
pricing models.

The semantic models generated by the Service Gatherer are used by [CloudAid2](https://github.com/dguedesb/CloudAid2) prototype.
